# NI VeriStand Scan Engine Module Libraries

The **NI VeriStand Scan Engine Module Libraries** provides built components to the [Scan Engine Custom Device](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-scan-engine-ethercat-custom-device) to support C Series and Remote I/O modules. Specifically, this repository contains the module UI and engine configuration code for all modules.

If installing the **Scan Engine Custom Device** from a [released package](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-scan-engine-ethercat-custom-device/releases/latest), you do not need to separately clone or install this component. Only modifications to the custom device's module support require using this repository as source. See the [documentation](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-scan-engine-ethercat-custom-device/blob/main/docs/Adding%20New%20Modules.md) found in the **Scan Engine Custom Device** repository for adding module support.
